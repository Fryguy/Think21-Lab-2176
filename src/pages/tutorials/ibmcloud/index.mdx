## Lab Overview

    IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Infrastructure Management delivers the insight, control, and automation enterprises need to address challenges of managing hybrid cloud environments, which are far more complex than traditional data center. This technology enables enterprises with existing virtual infrastructures to improve visibility and control, and those just starting virtualization deployments to build and operate a well-managed virtual infrastructure.

    IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Infrastructure Management includes the following feature sets:

    - Insight: discovery, monitoring, utilization, performance, reporting, analytics, chargeback, and trending.
    - Control: security, compliance, alerting, policy-based resource and configuration management.
    - Automate: IT process, task, and event, provisioning, workload management and orchestration.
    - Integrate: systems management, tools and processes, event consoles, CMDB, RBA, and web services.

    In this tutorial, you will explore the following key capabilities:

    - Understand Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Infrastructure Management capabilities for public clouds
    - Learn how to deploy a new service in a public cloud
    - Learn how to manage lifecycle of the service
    - Learn how to apply configuration and control policies to the managed VMs
    - Learn how Cloud Pak help SRE teams managing infrastructure in public clouds with full auditability

## Managing infrastructure in public clouds

    There are multiple technologies available to provision and manage IT services and infrastructure in public clouds. Each of them has some advantages and there is no way one can fully replace the others. This creates a real challenge for enterprises: "How to achieve consistency and traceability across all environments?". IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps - Infrastructure Management helps integrate different tools and technologies in the closed-loop management cycle.

    In the following exercise, you learn how to provision a new service in a public cloud using Terraform. You will extend the service (which initially provisions set of 2 virtual machines) with the configuration management task driven by Ansible. Then, you will explore how tags are mapped to provide a consistent view of the resources across all infrastructure providers and how to apply the configuration policies to ensure configuration governance.

### Exploring the cloud providers

    Log in to the Cloud Pak user interface with your assigned user id (studentX). From the "hamburger" menu in the top-left corner select **Automate infrastructure -> Infrastructure management**

    New browser tab opens with Infrastructure management user interface. Here, depending on the assigned permissions you can view and manage virtual machines in any of the connected environements. Let's explore infrastructure in public clouds. From the left-hand side menu select **Compute -> Providers**

    You should see some public cloud regions from different public providers registered. Due to the fact that this is a shared environment you cannot edit the providers, but you should know that IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps Infrastructure Management currently supports the following clouds:
    - Amazon EC2
    - Google Cloud Engine
    - IBM Cloud
    - Microsoft Azure
    - Microsoft Azure Stack
    - Openstack
    - VMware vCloud

    Additional providers are planned for second half of 2021

    Click on any of the available providers (for example us-east-ohio). You will see details of all resources provisioned in selected region (to which you have access rights assigned). To explore further, click on the **Instances**.

    If you cannot see any instances on the list, it means that your access rights are limited. Let's provision some new instances.

### Exploring the service library

    Go back to the main browser tab **IBM Cloud Pak for ...**. This time from the "hamburger" menu select **Automate infrastructure -> Manage services**.

    In case you access this module for the first time, "Welcome" screen may pop-up. If that happens, click on the **Service library** link.

    ![](images/2021-05-04-10-48-19.png)

    In the Service Library view you can see all services defined in the Cloud Pak. On the left you can see different service categories (1), on the right list of all services in a selected category (2). On top, there are additional tabs, where you can define the terraform templates for your environment. 

    ![](images/2021-05-04-10-53-46.png)

    Unfold versions of the **IBMCloud-2Node-App** service (1), then click on three dots on the right in the **(default)** row (2), and select **View** (3).
