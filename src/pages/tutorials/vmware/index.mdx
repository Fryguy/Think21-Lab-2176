# Title Provision Virtual Machines in VMware

In this exercise you will learn about the service library and how to use Terraform and other integrations to automate
tasks within a VMware environment.  Will begin by using an existing "Managed Service" to provision a Virtual Machine. 
Then you'll learn how to publish the service into the service library so that end users can run your service.  As an
administrator, you'll have more capabilities than a typical end user.  Finally, we'll explore some of the other capabilities
where you can leverage the power of combining Terraform, Ansible Tower, resthooks and other integrations to via our 
service composer to accomplish complex tasks.

Begin by selecting the hamburger menu in the upper left corner

Normally, you would use the welcome page to setup your VMware connections, create a Terraform template, and build a service.
In this lab, we have already done some of those steps.  Connections to VMware vCenter already exist and we are going to begin
with a pre-defined Terraform template.

- Click on the "Service Library" URL in step 3 as seen in previous picture.  Or, you can use the hamburger menu to Navigate
  to Library->Services

- You are now looking at the Manage service library.  Here, you'll see a number of Terraform based services that are provided
  with the product.  These services can be used to provision virtual machines, provision cloud services, perform cluster
  lifecycle management, install middleware, and more.  There is also an example template that includes an approval process. 
  This allows you to require an approval before resources are provisioned.

- Explore a few of the services.  On each of the services, you'll a description in the upper left corner.  There is also and
  link in the upper left corner named "Service library" that will take you back to the main service library page.
